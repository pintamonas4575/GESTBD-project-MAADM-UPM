2024-10-23,Charles Leclerc,1,"Charles Leclerc appeared to be slightly on the back foot in the Ferrari intra-team battle after Saturday’s action in Austin, having lost out to Carlos Sainz during the Sprint race and qualifying for the main event. However, the Monegasque came back fighting to brilliantly go from fourth to first at Turn 1 and then storm clear of the field. In Jenson Button’s words, Leclerc “put on a clinic” for his rivals.

2024-10-23,Liam Lawson,2,"Liam Lawson admitted he had a mountain to climb on his return to the F1 grid after a year on the sidelines, but the New Zealander scaled it in style. Mixing it with Fernando Alonso, catching the eye in qualifying and rising from 19th to ninth (following an engine penalty) got his push to land a full-time 2025 seat off to a very strong start – and left our judges suitably impressed.

2024-10-23,Carlos Sainz,3,"As mentioned above, Sainz had the upper hand over Leclerc across the Sprint race and qualifying, but his chances of fighting for the Grand Prix win were undone by his team mate getting ahead at the start and a costly power unit issue. Despite this, the Spaniard kept his composure to pick off Red Bull’s Max Verstappen via an undercut strategy and back up Leclerc for a statement Ferrari one-two finish.

2024-10-23,Max Verstappen,4,"Max Verstappen arrived at the Circuit of The Americas 52 points ahead of championship rival Lando Norris and – after a tense wheel-to-wheel battle in Sunday’s Grand Prix – left with that advantage topped up to 57. It was an impressive weekend of damage limitation for the reigning world champion, who must now feel a step closer to what would be title number four.

2024-10-23,Lando Norris,5,"Norris bounced back from defeat to Verstappen and Sainz in the Sprint race to bag pole for the Grand Prix – his sublime first lap proving decisive when George Russell crashed and brought out the yellow flags. As has often been the case in 2024, though, the McLaren driver’s first lap let him down and he spent the rest of the afternoon playing catch up. Norris snatched third from Verstappen late on, only for his off-track overtake to earn a five-second penalty and leave him fourth after the chequered flag.

After reaching SQ3 and recording a respectable Sprint finish, the Argentinian turned 15th into 10th – and the final point – with a determined drive during Sunday’s Grand Prix.

2024-10-23,Pierre Gasly,8,"Alpine were another team to unleash developments in the United States, with set-up changes  between the Sprint race and qualifying bringing the new package to life in Pierre Gasly’s hands – his fine P7 on the grid becoming P6 thanks to Russell’s pit lane start. He held onto that position across the first stint but, after reacting to Haas rival Kevin Magnussen’s early stop, the Frenchman’s race unfortunately fell apart via a slow pit lane service, traffic and struggles to get his hard tyres to work.

2024-10-23,Kevin Magnussen,9,"After their strong Sprint display, Magnussen was on course to join team mate Hulkenberg in the points again during Sunday’s Grand Prix and make it a ‘double double’ for Haas. But while Hulkenberg completed his race on a one-stop strategy, Magnussen – as touched on with Gasly above – swapped tyres early and ended up pitting twice. That second stop was a big blow to his efforts and meant he had to settle for 11th at the finish, just missing out on a point.

With major car changes required, the Mercedes man was moved to the pit lane for the start of Sunday’s encounter, in which he did well to recover to P6.

He was, quite simply, in a league of his own – even if there were a couple of brushes with the walls.

2024-09-25,Oliver Bearman,3,"As he has done so often this season and throughout his F1 career, Nico Hulkenberg starred in qualifying to line up a brilliant sixth on the grid for Haas. It was always going to be a big ask to keep that position in the race, given Fernando Alonso and the Ferraris were starting just behind, but ninth represented another very welcome reward for himself and Ayao Komatsu’s team in their quest to finish P6 in the constructors’ standings.

Starting ninth after losing his sole Q3 time over track limits, Leclerc battled past the likes of Hulkenberg and Alonso before going long on his first stint.

However, the Australian dusted himself down and came back determined to right those wrongs in the race, staying out longer than anyone else and picking off Mercedes pair Hamilton and George Russell on his much fresher tyres.

2024-09-25,Franco Colapinto,7,"Amid the heat, humidity and tight confines of the Marina Bay track, Franco Colapinto delivered another composed performance in what is becoming a superb stand-in display at Williams. All but matching team mate Alex Albon in qualifying, the Argentinian muscled his way past at the start and ran inside the points for a chunk of the race. An undercut from Perez agonisingly dropped him to P11, but the rookie could walk away proud of his efforts for the third successive weekend.

2024-09-25,George Russell,8,"Mercedes came alive in the final stages of qualifying to secure a surprise third and fourth on the grid with Hamilton and Russell respectively. While Hamilton opted for softs at the start, Russell went for the more popular medium-shod approach, something that paid off as strategies unfolded over 62 punishing laps. While he could do nothing to stop Piastri from passing for the final podium spot, Russell kept Leclerc at bay late on to take a well-earned P4.

He tried to keep the McLaren and Red Bull machines in sight in the opening laps, aided by his starting set of softs, but fell out of podium contention via a particularly early stop that he questioned over the radio.

Piastri, though, had other ideas, launching past the Ferrari man at the start of Lap 20 and keeping him at bay thereafter.

Verstappen scored an eye catching 19 wins this year, became the first driver to lead over 1,000 laps in a season, and set the record for most consecutive wins, with 10.

It is hard to argue against him, as he and Aston Martin shocked the paddock at the start of the year by being the closest challengers to Red Bull. The Spaniard chalked up eight podiums this year – six of them in the opening eight races.

What was just as impressive was the consistency he showed when Ferrari did not have the pace earlier in the year.

He made excellent starts from fifth in both the Sprint and the race, but such was the pace and tyre degradation issues of his W14 that he quickly fell back into the clutches of the chasing pack. He wound up seventh in the 100KM dash and eighth in the race with Mercedes left searching for answers ahead of Las Vegas.

But the positives were his qualifying pace, as he was only a whisker away from taking pole from Leclerc.

He was imperious on Saturday during the Shootout and the Sprint, which he won, but you could argue he was even better on Sunday.

The Spaniard dominated to take a stunning win, and it might not have been possible without an outstanding performance in qualifying that saw him start on pole. But even after holding the lead all race, the win looked to be slipping away when both Mercedes cars strapped on some fresh mediums and hunted down the leaders. Sainz showed he has the race intelligence to match his speed as a cunning DRS plan kept him and Norris in first and second, allowing him to take the first non-Red Bull win of the year.

In the upgraded MCL60, Norris found himself always competing at the sharp end of the field, and a strong pit stop saw him leap ahead of Charles Leclerc to be in the podium places. And when he was required to defend from George Russell, he did that, earning him and McLaren a well-earned second place.

He ended up starting the race from third and, after a fighting performance, he took the team’s first podium in two years. Can he add more to his tally after the summer break?

2023-08-02,Max Verstappen,1,"These days, no matter what is thrown his way, Verstappen seems to be able to withstand any challenges at the moment. Whether it was a five-place grid penalty for the race, or Oscar Piastri undercutting him for the lead in the Sprint, he still triumphed in Belgium. In truth, Verstappen did what he has done all year in Spa, which is to dominate the competition. He qualified fastest for the Sprint and race, before taking victory in both, to cap an extraordinary first half of the year for him and his team.

2023-08-02,Lewis Hamilton,2,"Hamilton capped off a strong first half of the season with another splendid performance, this time to take fourth place on Sunday. But it could have been better, especially given the fact that he was sat in provisional pole in the Shootout on Saturday.  Traffic, in the form of his team mate George Russell, cost him a potential shot at pole, and a penalty for colliding with Sergio Perez in the Sprint dropped him from fourth to seventh. He then tried to reel in Charles Leclerc for third in the race, but just did not have the legs. All in all, it was the customary solid weekend for Hamilton.

He also impressed in qualifying, going toe to toe with Verstappen, before ultimately losing out to the Dutch driver – although Verstappen's five place grid drop lifted him to a P1 start in the race. If Friday was a reminder of Leclerc’s epic one lap pace, Sunday was to show how much of an all-round racer he is. While he could not match the pace of Red Bulls, he maximised the performance of his car to take a well-earned third place.

Unfortunately, he lost out at the start on Sunday, and while his getaway was not poor, he could not account for the others getting away better at the line.

However, it was not just his battling performance on Sunday that caught the eye, it was his brave call to switch to the soft tyres first in Q2. That decision set him up to start higher up the grid, and he absolutely made it count, in truly impressive fashion.

But the question must be if he continues to drive “out of his skin” like his boss Christian Horner says, how high could he go on this list by the end of the year?  Yet again, it was another weekend where he looked untouchable, especially in qualifying, mastering his way through the wet to take a dominant pole.

Alonso did lose P2 to Lewis Hamilton at the start, but later took it back from his old rival.

Unfortunately for him, he lost out in the first round of pit stops and ended up down the order.

But at the Safety Car restart, a switch was turned on, as he dived down the inside of Piastri at the hairpin.

In the much improved SF-23, Leclerc twice beat both Red Bulls to qualify in P1, and although he eventually lost out to them in race trim, he drove outstandingly to give Ferrari their first podium of the year in the Grand Prix, holding off Fernando Alonso to do so.

He qualified sixth for the Grand Prix, and was only eighth in the Sprint Shootout, but in race trim, he was his usual calculating best. He finished sixth in the Sprint, before getting up to fourth in the Grand Prix, producing one of the highlights of the weekend with his opportunistic overtake on Carlos Sainz. He could not chase down Leclerc for third, but it was still an accomplished drive from the Spaniard.

But if you ever needed a reminder of the skill Hamilton possesses, look at his overtakes at the restart. His moves past Nico Hulkenberg, Esteban Ocon, and his team mate George Russell were magnificent, before he later capitalised on Lance Stroll’s mistake to get up to sixth.

DNFs came again in Italy and Singapore, which left the Aston Martin-bound driver frustrated, but he pulled it back with P7 in Japan and the USA, and P5 in Brazil – as sparks flew between him and team mate Esteban Ocon.

2022-05-11,Carlos Sainz,6,"Carlos Sainz's FP2 crash seemed a logical continuation of his recent woes but the Spaniard shrugged that – and the physical aches – off, qualifying on the second row behind Leclerc on Saturday after Verstappen's mistake. Yes, Verstappen scythed past with ease at the start, with Sainz perhaps hoping he could have held up the champion a bit longer. Sainz instead withheld an underpowered Sergio Perez for the final podium place.

He delivered a performance which handed Honda their first US GP victory since 1991, Red Bull their first US GP victory since 2013, and his own maiden victory Stateside. All of which impressed our judging panel. ",https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/f1-power-rankings-who-impressed-our-judges-most-on-f1s-return-to-austin.4SqHzGd1qDo6MnZYq9rYTy

The Monegasque driver even thought he could have gained a podium on Sunday. That he finished only 10 seconds off Red Bull's Sergio Perez only underlines his case.

Outdoing Verstappen into Turn 1, Hamilton had the lead until Red Bull opened up the undercut and caused the Briton a strategy headache. He gave chase admirably, pitting later than Verstappen for his final stint and ending up with an 8.8 second deficit to the leader on fresher tyres. But numerous other factors – including heat, backmarkers, and the Dutchman's late burst of speed – combined to deprive him of victory.

Starting P4 in tricky conditions, Gasly’s race got off to a sub-optimal start when he spun Fernando Alonso around at Turn 1 and copped a five-second penalty. To race through that and finish just 10s adrift of the podium places, and three seconds off Hamilton’s rear wing, was a great performance from Gasly – while he sent yet another message to his Red Bull paymasters by outqualifying Sergio Perez in a straight fight (not counting F1 Sprints) for the fifth time this season.

But thereafter, he redeemed himself with the sort of battling rear gunner drive that backed up Red Bull’s decision to slot him into the second seat at the team.

Leclerc’s home curse continues, alas, with the Monegasque unable to start the race from his first pole position since the 2019 Mexican Grand Prix. Leclerc demonstrated fantastic pace all weekend, recovering well from his gearbox issues in FP1 to head FP2 and carry that form into qualifying. But then, with provisional pole his, Leclerc – much like at Baku 2019 – stuffed the car into the wall at the exit of the Swimming Pool, causing the damage that would ultimately rule him out of the race.

Not only that, but a sweet move around the outside of Bottas on Lap 1 meant that Leclerc spent 28 of the 66 laps in P3, a timely reminder that, when Ferrari can ultimately give him a race-winning car again, Leclerc will do the rest.

Nonetheless, there were positives aplenty to take, Verstappen demonstrating expert brinkmanship with his dive for the lead on Lap 1, qualifying just 0.036s off Hamilton (compared to 0.708s last year!), while he and Hamilton were quite simply in a league of two at the front of the field throughout the race.

Ultimately he’d fall back in the race, with Alpine’s one-stop strategy ultimately costing him positions to Daniel Ricciardo, Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris late on.

Although the titanium-jawed Alonso admitted he still didn’t feel particularly in tune with his new Alpine A521, the Spaniard put the car into Q3, ultimately qualifying P9 and enjoying a few tussles in the race before a sandwich wrapper (hopefully not a Lidl one) in his rear brake duct forced him into retirement.

That made his performance at the Bahrain Grand Prix a mite disappointing, Bottas never looking like being the fastest Mercedes driver – while despite showing strong pace mid-race, a 10.9s pit stop would fully extinguish any chances he had of competing with the leading pair of Hamilton and Verstappen. At least Bottas limited the damage to just a third place, to help Mercedes move to the top of the constructors’ after race one.
